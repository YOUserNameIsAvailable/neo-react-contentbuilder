Using ContentBuilder.js in React

---------------------------------------

Setup React Project

1) Extract the react-contentbuilder.zip file and start the installation

    > cd react-contentbuilder
    > npm install

2) To start:

    Run NodeJs server for image/file upload handling (optional, but needed in this example)

    > node server.js

    Open another terminal and start the project:

    > npm start


    Note:

    Image/file upload is not part of ContentBuilder.js functionality.
    It is optional and in this sample project, we use NodeJs (you can use any backend server, eg. PHP, etc).
    With this functionality you can upload local image or video files for embedding into your content.

    Files will be uploaded in uploads/ folder.
